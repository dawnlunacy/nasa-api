# Space Rocks

Space Rocks is a React-Redux App that uses the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API & the Asteroids Near Earth Object Web Service API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to allow a user to search by week and see the Near Earth Objects (astroids and comets) for that week.

### Focuses

- Consume an API and build a functional and well tested application in 5 days.

- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.

- Become comfortable with making network requests with an API key.

- Solidify concepts with React to create clean and re-useable components.

- Become comfortable with Reduxâ€™s lifecycle, creating actions, reducers, and connecting them to React components.

- Understand and solidify concepts with React component, asynchronous code, and Redux testing.

  DOM Display:
  - Space Rocks asteroid page loads with the current week. Nasa's Astronomy picture of the day is the background image and it updates daily:
